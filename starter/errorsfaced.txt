1. When running the test cases and printing the returned neo i have observed that the neo objects are storing duplicate orbit paths also i.e, the date of orbit and distance are same for two orbits. Accroding to csv there are
duplicate elements.

Souliton :1
---------------
To solve This issue i have added equals function in orbit class which tells if two orbit paths are same based on date and distance. When the neo updates orbits it will check if the orbit is already present in list by using the equals
method. So now in the orbits list of the noe object there will be no duplicate entries. 


Issue no 2
---------------
1. When Query is to be built we get arguments passed as input. But that argument contains all keys eg: bot Date and Start_date,End_date all three keys will be present. So if in the args date is mentioned rest of the two keys
 will be None when checking on which we have to search it is showing an issue.

Solution For 2
-------------------
So when we receive kwargs in query init function we remove all the Key,value pairs with None as value so that only required Keys are present.


Issue no 3
---------------
When i was going through result of test cases where we apply filter it shows wrong answer and the reasons were the neos on which we apply filter had duplicate neos also and some of the neo where containing true in the hazardous
filed.

Solution 3
---------------
In Search file before applying filter convert neo name list to set and then add neo objects to neo_list so duplicate elements will not add into list. In Models file when storing hazardous store them as boolean False or 
boolean True not in String format.
